Scenario: 
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers. Customers who purchased single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchased annual memberships are referred to as members. The finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual ridders. The Director of Marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members is key to the company’s success and future growth.
The key steps followed in the analysis:

Ask
Prepare
Process
Analyze
Share
Act
STEP 1: ASK
The ask phase of the data analysis process involves recognizing the current problem, defining the business task at hand, considering key stakeholders and identifying how the insights and findings will help stakeholders.

STEP 2: PREPARE
The Prepare phase of data analysis involves preparing the data. In this process, data is collected from different sources relevant to problem and the different metrics needed for analysis is identified.

STEP 3: PROCESS
The third phase of data analysis is to process the data and clean it for analysis. Data processing involves finding inaccuracies, errors, inconsistency in data and getting rid of them to have a neat data to work on that avoids any discrepancy or result skew due to “bad data”. This will ensure that the results are accurate and don’t affect the credibility of the analysis.

Data cleaning
Data manipulation
Renaming columns
Converting column datatypes
Remove unwanted columns

STEP 4: ANALYSIS
The fourth phase is to analyze the data. The main goal in this phase is to find trends, patterns and relationship between data that will help solve the main business goal at hand.
We performed analysis on the data and calculated important metrics like: average ride length, maximum ride length, minimum ride length using the aggregate() function.

STEP 5: SHARE
The fifth phase is where we share the data findings. This is done by creating impactful visualizations in the form of graphs and plots to convey the findings more quickly.

STEP 6: ACT
The sixth phase is the Act phase. In this phase, we will use everything we have learned from our analysis, arrive at a conclusion and act upon it. 
Three areas of focus and recommendations:

Seasonality: Increase in demand for casual riders during Spring and Summer is an opportunity to target advertising campaigns and promotional activities during this time.
Recommendation:

Launch casual rider email campaign in early Spring and run it through Summer.
Schedule offers and promotions for early bird sign-ups, discounted membership for signing up ahead of busy season, highlight advantages of becoming an annual member v/s staying casual rider.
2. What are they using bikes for? : It is established that annual members are more active mid-week, have consistent ride length whereas casual riders use for weekend entertainment purposes.

Recommendation:

To offer more flexibility, introduce weekend passes tailored to weekend activities and entertainment.
Use digital marketing channels to market the new weekend passes.
Locate most frequented spots by the casual riders using the map, partner with the locations, set up promotional counters and offer discounts on membership, with entertainment pairings (eg. restaurant discounts, entry pass to sport venues). Highlight advantages of becoming annual member.
3. Usage days: Annual members use it more during weekdays while the casual riders use it on the weekends

Recommendation:

Use digital marketing channels to promote the usage of bikes during weekdays, maybe to commute to work to encourage more and more people to use a more sustainable medium. It promotes physical fitness, reduces traffic congestion, and lowers carbon emissions, contributing to a healthier lifestyle and a more sustainable urban environment.
